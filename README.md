🌐 Browser-use is the easiest way to connect your AI agents with the browser.


# Quick start

With pip (Python>=3.11):

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

For memory functionality (requires Python<3.13 due to PyTorch compatibility):  

```bash
pip install "browser-use[memory]"
```

Install Patchright:
```bash
patchright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
GROK_API_KEY=
NOVITA_API_KEY=
```



# Vision

Tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.

## Roadmap

### Agent

- [ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
- [ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
- [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

- [ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
- [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

- [ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
- [ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience

- [ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
- [ ] Improve docs
- [ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization

- [ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.
